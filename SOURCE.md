The images we release are the result of building coreboot using the
configuration in our git repository at https://github.com/merge/skulls

	git clone https://github.com/merge/skulls

The coreboot source code is available via git:

	git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot.git

In case there are external patches applied to build coreboot, they are
available in the sources directory too.
