# skulls - TODO list

## the random list
* make it easy to install HEADS, probably a helper script and documentation
* add scripts to build a release reproducibly
* find legal information on Intel's VGA bios binary
* create a logo for the project
* add support for the X1 carbon, 1st generation
* support the ch341a just like the RPi

## why this list
While we use [Github issue](https://github.com/merge/skulls/issues) for tracking
TODOs, we want to be somewhat independent of Github. The main repository is
mirrored to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/skulls/skulls) for example.
This should hold a high-level summary of things that we want to do.
