# Skulls - TODO list

* release something that can be installed systemwide
* coreboot: fix the bootsplash image size when using SeaVGABIOS / native graphics init
* create a live USB Linux for flashing including Skulls, flashrom and iomem=relaxed

## why this list
While we use [Github issue](https://github.com/merge/skulls/issues) for tracking
TODOs, we want to be somewhat independent of Github. The main repository is
mirrored to [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/skulls/skulls) for example.
This should hold a high-level summary of things that we want to do.
